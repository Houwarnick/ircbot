See requirements.txt for... the requirements.  The easiest way to install them is with pip.
Built using python 2.7.3.

### Ubuntu Installation:

You will probably need the libxml2-dev and libxslt-dev packages (for BeautifulSoup, used for scrapers). 

`apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev`

Then you can run this:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

This should be all you need.
